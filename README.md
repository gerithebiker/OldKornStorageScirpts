# OldKornStorageScirpts
These scripts were written a few years back, but there could be usefull parts.
Originally all the scripts were developed for 7Mode OnTap controllers, but later CMODE was added.

The scripts in this format should NOT be used, as they were designed for a specific environment. If you want to use any of them, it is your responsibility to make sure they will not cause any harm in your environment!
